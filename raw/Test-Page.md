Text with `inline code` and...

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
{
    printf("This is a code block.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

if you disabled `sanitize` function in your configuration, then <font color="#66CCFF">HTML</font> <font color="#FF0000">can</font> be used.

BTW, MathJax is also built-in supported - you just need to enable them.

When ^^^math $a \ne 0$ ^^^, there are two solutions to ^^^math \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) ^^^ and they are

^^^math
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
^^^

_(You can take a look at [source file](/MinoriWiki/raw/Test-Page.md) on how to make MathJax work.)_

Need more explanations? Write abbr here and add a foot note[^exp1].

*[abbr]: Abbreviation 

[^exp1]: This is a corresponding footer note.
That could last multiple lines and accepts **markdown** as well.
